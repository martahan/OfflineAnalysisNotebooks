# OfflineAnalysisNotebooks

This Jupyter Notebook contains the script used to generate plots of observed times taken for a program run which followed a certain subpath.
In order to reproduce these results, clone this repository alongside VyPR, VyPRServer and VyPRAnalysis (if you clone those inside this repository, please omit the second line in the section about imports (sys.append(".."))).
Once you run the notebook using 'jupyter notebook' command, follow the steps described in the notebook to obtain the results. Please note that, for now, the first instruction is to omit running the server from the notebook - please run the server in a separate terminal as 'python run_service.py'.
